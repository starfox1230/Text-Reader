HEAD TRAUMA
Imaging Strategy
Skull Films. Skull fracture, with or without signs of neurological injury, is an independent risk factor for a neurosurgically relevant intracranial lesion. Therefore, in the setting of clinically occult head trauma, the diagnosis of skull fracture serves to alert the clinician to the possibility of an immediate or delayed neurologically relevant intracranial lesion. However, conventional radiography itself (film or digital) is not sensitive for detection of intracranial pathology and should not be performed in lieu of a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Patients who are judged to be at low risk for intracranial injury on the basis of a careful history and physical examination should be observed, and patients at high risk should be imaged by CT. Skull films virtually never demonstrate significant findings in the low-risk group and are inadequate to characterize or exclude intracranial injury in the high-risk group. Further, the absence of skull fractures on conventional radiography does not exclude significant intracranial injury. In fact, in one large autopsy series of patients with fatal head injuries, only 75% had skull fractures. The decision to obtain a head CT in the setting of trauma must be based on clinical grounds.
CT. Imaging of acute head trauma is performed to detect treatable lesions before secondary neurologic damage occurs. Currently, this is best performed by CT for several reasons: it is quick, widely available, and highly accurate in the detection of acute intra- and extra-axial hemorrhage, as well as skull, temporal bone, facial, and orbital fractures. Monitoring equipment is easily accommodated. CT images must be reviewed using multiple windows. A narrow window width is used to evaluate the brain, a slightly wider window width is used to exaggerate contrast between extra-axial collections and the adjacent skull, and a very wide window is used to evaluate the skull itself. Contiguous 5-mm sections through the brain provide sufficient detail and can be obtained with modern scanners in less than 15 minutes. Thinner sections are used to evaluate the orbits, facial skeleton, and skull base. Intravenous contrast media is not used in the acute setting because it may mimic or mask underlying hemorrhage. When CT is performed in unconscious patients with severe head injury, it may be wise to include routine coverage of the craniocervical junction. A study by Link et al found that 18% of these patients had fractures of C-1, C-2, or the occipital condyles and that roughly half of all fractures were missed by plain radiographs.
MRI has traditionally been less desirable than CT in the acute setting because of the longer examination times, difficulty in managing life-support and other monitoring equipment, and inferior demonstration of bone detail. MR, however, has been shown to be comparable or superior to CT in the detection of acute epidural and subdural hematomas and nonhemorrhagic brain injury. MR is also more sensitive to brain stem injury and to acute, subacute and chronic hemorrhage, especially with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) T2*-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. Diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging have improved detection of both acute and chronic neuronal injury. In the majority of cases, MR is the modality of choice for patients with subacute and chronic head injury and is recommended for patients with acute head trauma when neurologic findings are unexplained by CT. MR is also more accurate in predicting long-term prognosis. With the development of parallel imaging, faster imaging sequences, advanced imaging methods such as MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion, and magnetization transfer imaging, improved monitoring equipment, and greater scanner availability, MR will continue to play an increasing role in the evaluation of acute head trauma. 

Scalp Injury
When interpreting CT scans for head trauma, it is helpful to begin by examining the extracranial structures for evidence of scalp injury or radiopaque foreign bodies. Scalp soft-tissue swelling is often the only reliable evidence of the site of impact. The subgaleal hematoma is the most common manifestation of scalp injury and can be recognized on CT or MR as focal soft-tissue swelling of the scalp located beneath the subcutaneous fibrofatty tissue and above the temporalis muscle and calvarium.

Skull Fractures
Nondisplaced linear fractures of the calvarium are the most common type of skull fracture. They may be difficult to detect on CT scans, especially when the fracture plane is parallel to the plane of section. Fortunately, isolated linear skull fractures do not require treatment. Surgical management is usually indicated for depressed and compound skull fractures, both of which are seen better on CT scans than on plain films. Depressed fractures are frequently associated with an underlying contusion. Intracranial air (“pneumocephalus”) may be seen with compound skull fractures or fractures involving the paranasal sinuses. Thin-section CT using a bone algorithm is the best method to evaluate fractures in critical areas, such as the skull base, orbit, or facial bones. Thin sections can also be helpful to evaluate the degree of comminution and depression of bone fragments.

Temporal Bone Fractures
Thin-section, high-resolution CT scanning has led to a dramatic improvement in the ability to detect and characterize temporal bone fractures. Patients with fractures of the temporal bone may present with deafness, facial nerve palsies, vertigo, dizziness, or nystagmus. Clinical symptoms are often masked in the presence of other serious injuries. Physical signs of temporal bone fracture include hemotympanum, CSF otorrhea, and ecchymosis over the mastoid process (“Battle sign”). Temporal bone fractures may be first suspected on standard head CT scans performed to exclude intracranial injury. Findings such as opacification of the mastoid air cells, fluid in the middle ear cavity, pneumocephalus, or occasionally, pneumolabyrinth, should raise the suspicion of a temporal bone fracture. Optimal evaluation of a suspected temporal bone fracture requires thin-section (1 to 1.5 mm) axial and direct coronal CT imaging using a bone algorithm. With multidetector CT, thinner section axial imaging can be performed, and coronal reformats may be adequate for interpretation.
Fractures of the temporal bone can be classified either according to their orientation relative to the long axis of the petrous bone or according to their involvement of the otic capsule. On the basis of the older Ulrich’s classification, if the fracture parallels the long axis of the petrous pyramid, it is termed a “longitudinal” fracture; fractures perpendicular to the long axis of the petrous bone are termed “transverse” fractures. “Mixed” fracture types also occur. 
The longitudinal temporal bone fracture represents 70% to 90% of temporal bone fractures. It results from a blow to the side of the head. Complications include conductive hearing loss, dislocation or fracture of the ossicles, and CSF otorrhinorrhea. Facial nerve palsy may occur, but it is often delayed and incomplete. Sensorineural hearing loss is uncommon.
The transverse temporal bone fracture usually results from a blow to the occiput or frontal region. Complications are usually more severe and include sensorineural hearing loss, severe vertigo, nystagmus, and perilymphatic fistula. Facial palsy is seen in 30% to 50% of these cases and is often complete. Transverse fractures may also involve the carotid canal or jugular foramen, causing injury to the carotid artery or jugular vein.
Mixed and oblique fracture types also occur, and the simple classification of fractures as longitudinal or transverse may not be sufficient. Otic capsule sparing fractures run anterolateral to the otic capsule, and are usually caused by direct blows to the temporoparietal region. With otic capsule violating fractures, the cochlea and the semicircular canals are damaged. These fractures are the results of direct impacts to the occipital region. Compared with otic sparing fractures, patients with otic capsule violating fractures are 2 to 5 times more likely to develop facial nerve injury, 4 to 8 times more likely to develop CSF leak, and 7 to 25 times more likely to experience hearing loss, as well as more likely to sustain intracranial injuries such as epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Head Injury Classification
Classification of Head Injury. Traumatic head injury can be divided into primary and secondary forms. Primary lesions are those that occur as a direct result of a blow to the head. Secondary lesions occur as a consequence of primary lesions, usually as a result of mass effect or vascular compromise. Secondary lesions are often preventable, whereas primary injuries, by definition, have already occurred by the time the patient arrives in the emergency department.
Primary lesions include epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and intraventricular hemorrhage, as well as diffuse axonal injury (DAI), cortical contusions, intracerebral hematomas, and subcortical gray matter injury. Direct injury to the cerebral vasculature is another type of primary lesion.
Secondary lesions include cerebral swelling, brain herniation, hydrocephalus, ischemia or infarction, CSF leak, leptomeningeal cyst, and encephalomalacia.
Brain stem injury, which is also divided into primary and secondary forms, is discussed later in this chapter.</h1>
